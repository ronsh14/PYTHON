# ERROR HANDLING

# TRY AND EXCEPT BLOCK

    print("An error occurred while parsing data: ", e)  # Output: An error occurred while parsing data:
    # invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'This is not a number'

# Else Block

    print("Division by zero error occurred")
else:
    # Else block catches if no exception occurred in the try block

# Finally Block

    result = 10 / 0
